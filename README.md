### 1.[New feature] Carbon Emission Dashboard:
This feature provides a visual representation of an organization's carbon emissions data and performance. Users can access real-time data on their carbon emissions across different scopes (Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3). The dashboard provides key metrics, trends, and comparisons to help organizations track their progress and identify areas for improvement. This feature helps organizations gain a clear understanding of their carbon emissions profile and make data-driven decisions to reduce their environmental impact.

### 2.[New feature] Carbon Emission Report (TGO format):
This feature generates carbon emissions reports following the format and guidelines set by the Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (TGO). Users can input their emissions data, select the applicable scopes, and generate comprehensive reports that meet TGO reporting requirements. The report includes detailed information on emissions sources, calculations, methodologies, and any mitigation measures implemented. This feature helps organizations streamline the reporting process and ensures compliance with TGO guidelines.

### 3.[New feature] Scope 3 Indirect GHG Emission Assessment Form:
This feature provides a form for assessing and reporting Scope 3 indirect greenhouse gas emissions. Users can input relevant data, such as supplier emissions, employee commuting, business travel, and other indirect emissions sources. The system calculates and aggregates the data to provide a comprehensive assessment of Scope 3 emissions. This feature helps organizations understand the full extent of their carbon footprint, beyond direct emissions, and identify opportunities for emissions reduction.

### 4.[New feature] Scope 1 Direct GHG Emission Data:
This feature allows users to input and track data related to Scope 1 direct greenhouse gas emissions. Users can input emissions data from sources that are owned or controlled by the organization, such as on-site fuel combustion or manufacturing processes. The system organizes and presents the data, enabling organizations to monitor their direct emissions over time. This feature helps organizations assess their direct emissions impact and implement targeted reduction strategies.

### 5.[New feature] Scope 2 Energy Indirect GHG Emission Data:
This feature enables users to input and monitor data related to Scope 2 energy indirect greenhouse gas emissions.  Users can input information on energy consumption, such as electricity or heat, and the corresponding emissions factors. The system calculates and tracks emissions from energy consumption, providing insights into energy efficiency and emissions reduction opportunities. This feature helps organizations understand their energy-related emissions and make informed decisions to improve energy efficiency.
