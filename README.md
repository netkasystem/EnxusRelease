### 1.[New feature] Carbon Emission Dashboard:
This feature provides a visual representation of an organization's carbon emissions data and performance. Users can access real-time data on their carbon emissions across different scopes (Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3). The dashboard provides key metrics, trends, and comparisons to help organizations track their progress and identify areas for improvement. This feature helps organizations gain a clear understanding of their carbon emissions profile and make data-driven decisions to reduce their environmental impact.

### 2.[New feature] Carbon Emission Report (TGO format):
This feature generates carbon emissions reports following the format and guidelines set by the Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (TGO). Users can input their emissions data, select the applicable scopes, and generate comprehensive reports that meet TGO reporting requirements. The report includes detailed information on emissions sources, calculations, methodologies, and any mitigation measures implemented. This feature helps organizations streamline the reporting process and ensures compliance with TGO guidelines.

### 3.[New feature] Scope 3 Indirect GHG Emission Assessment Form:
This feature provides a form for assessing and reporting Scope 3 indirect greenhouse gas emissions. Users can input relevant data, such as supplier emissions, employee commuting, business travel, and other indirect emissions sources. The system calculates and aggregates the data to provide a comprehensive assessment of Scope 3 emissions. This feature helps organizations understand the full extent of their carbon footprint, beyond direct emissions, and identify opportunities for emissions reduction.

### 4.[New feature] Scope 1 Direct GHG Emission Data:
This feature allows users to input and track data related to Scope 1 direct greenhouse gas emissions. Users can input emissions data from sources that are owned or controlled by the organization, such as on-site fuel combustion or manufacturing processes. The system organizes and presents the data, enabling organizations to monitor their direct emissions over time. This feature helps organizations assess their direct emissions impact and implement targeted reduction strategies.

### 5.[New feature] Scope 2 Energy Indirect GHG Emission Data:
This feature enables users to input and monitor data related to Scope 2 energy indirect greenhouse gas emissions.  Users can input information on energy consumption, such as electricity or heat, and the corresponding emissions factors. The system calculates and tracks emissions from energy consumption, providing insights into energy efficiency and emissions reduction opportunities. This feature helps organizations understand their energy-related emissions and make informed decisions to improve energy efficiency. 


### 6.[New feature] Scope 3 Other Indirect GHG Emission Data:
This feature allows users to input and track data related to other indirect greenhouse gas emissions not covered in Scope 1 or Scope 2. Users can input information on emissions sources such as upstream and downstream activities, waste generation, and water use. The system aggregates the data and provides visibility into the organization's other indirect emissions. This feature helps organizations identify and address additional emission sources, promote sustainable practices throughout the value chain, and reduce their overall environmental impact.

### 7.[New feature] User & Role Management:
This feature enables organizations to manage user accounts and roles within the carbon emissions tracking platform. Users with administrative access can create and manage user accounts, assign roles, and control access permissions. The system ensures data security and confidentiality by granting appropriate access and permissions to each user. This feature helps organizations maintain control over their carbon emissions data, collaborate effectively, and ensure data integrity.


### 8.[New feature] Permission Management:
This feature allows organizations to configure and manage permission settings for different user roles and levels of access. Users can define customized permission levels, restricting or granting access to specific data, reports, or system functionalities. The system enforces permission settings to ensure data privacy and security. This feature helps organizations maintain data confidentiality, comply with privacy regulations, and control access to sensitive information.



### 9.[New feature] Emission Factor Management:
This feature enables organizations to manage and update emission factors used in their carbon emissions calculations. Users can input and update the latest emission factors for different emission sources, such as fuel combustion or energy consumption. The system automatically applies the updated factors to calculate accurate emissions data. This feature helps organizations stay up to date with emission factors, ensure data accuracy, and maintain compliance with reporting standards.
